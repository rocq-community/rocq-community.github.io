## About

[<img src="coq-logo.svg" align="right" width="100">](https://github.com/coq-community/manifesto)

Rocq-community is a project for a collaborative, community-driven effort for the long-term
maintenance and advertisement of packages for the [Rocq Prover](https://rocq-prover.org).
The organization is run by volunteer Rocq users. Everyone is welcome - you don't need to be a
very experienced Rocq user to participate. See the
[contributing guide](https://github.com/rocq-community/manifesto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information on how to get involved.

## Project Hosting

Repositories for Rocq-related projects can be hosted in the
[Rocq-community organization on GitHub](https://github.com/rocq-community)
whenever any of the following is the case:

- the project has become a collective work (several community members are
  actively working on it);
- the initial author has stopped maintaining the project and someone else is
  volunteering to do so;
- the initial author is still maintaining the project but they want to
  encourage other community members to participate in the maintenance and
  possibly take over (and the project is indeed raising interest from the
  community);
- the project is a library or tool of general interest and it makes sense to
  develop it collaboratively.

Once a project has joined Rocq-community, community members collaborate to ensure:

- project package definitions are continuously published in Rocq's [opam package index](https://rocq-prover.org/packages)
  and other relevant venues;
- projects use best practices for automation (e.g., building and continuous integration) as
  the project and Rocq itself evolves;
- projects provide rich metadata and documentation to enable application in other projects
  and in research.

More details can be found in the Rocq-community [manifesto](https://github.com/rocq-community/manifesto),
in particular on the process for [proposing a new package](https://github.com/rocq-community/manifesto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#proposing-a-new-package).
